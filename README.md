# Design Detailed Document
 Description:
 -My webpage uses white and blue as its main colors and its style it's all alligned in the middle. 
 -It has got the all the things the instructions told us and i chose to the my topic about colognes.

 Problems during development:
 -Lack of time due to my poor organization.
 -There were some errors that I, at first, didn't know how to solution, but carefully reading the presentation i realized the way it should be done.
 -Problems with the height of the styles that i solutioned creating three of them with different size.
 Conclusions:
 -Creating a web page and doing a software project at a beginner level is not necessarily an incredibly difficult things, but i realized that there are is a main things you want to search for since the start that is organization, if your project is organised since the beginning it would be easier to find things and relate one thing to another in the course of the project. If you start without any organization the mess would only grow bigger and bigger as the project continues.
