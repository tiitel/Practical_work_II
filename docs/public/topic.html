            <h1>TOP 3 2024 MEN COLOGNES</h1>
            <p>Nowadays the cologne industry is massive and entering in this "world" might be difficult , for this reason i leave you here my top 3 colognes to this day </p>
            <ol reversed>
                <li><b> Y Eau de Parfum (Yves Saint Laurent)</b></li>
                <p>A classic, well known for it's versatility, making it possible to use it in any time of the ayer an for any occassion.<br>
                It's fresh and clean, but it also includes a mature touch that suits it perfectly. <br>
                It lasts about 6 hours depending on your skin and the quantity you use, but for a fresh fragance its all you could ask for </p>
                <img src="../images/col1.jpg" height="400px">
                <li><b>Spicebomb extreme (Viktor & Rolf)</b></li>
                <p>This fragance, in my opinion, is the best winter-fall fragance that exist for a normal price and here is why.<br>
                It's sweet since the main note is the vanilla one, you would think that this vanilla would smell like a woman, <br>
                but spicebomb implement some tobacco and spicy notes that makes it perfect for a man <br>
                This one lasts 7-8 hours so you can apply once a day you are going to smell for all the time you are so it's great </p>
                
                <img src="../images/col3.jpg" height="400px">
                <li><b>The Omniscient Mr Thompson (Penhaligon's)</b></li>
                <p>This fragance its the definition of a winter fragance, it's practically perfect for this time of the year(if it wasn't for the price), while ,sadly, <br>
                its impossible to wear in summer It has some vanilla too but this one, unlike spicebomb, has some indistinguishable iris and woody notes that makes it,<br>
                for me, the best fragance of this year. It also last like 10 hours so you know you are paying for quality</p>
